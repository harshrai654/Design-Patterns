# Proxy Pattern

The Proxy Pattern provides a surrogate or
placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### Three types/use-cases of Proxies:

- Virtual/Cache Proxy
- Security Proxy
- Remote Proxy

*Use the Proxy Pattern to create a representative object
that controls access to another object, which may be ***remote,
expensive to create, or in need of securing***.*
